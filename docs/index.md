[Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) development in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes inline code evaluation, Paredit, code formatting, a test runner, syntax highlighting, [linting](linting.md), and more. [Calva is open source](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) and free to use.

## Getting Started

First thing you need to do is to get [Calva connected to the REPL of your project](connect.md). Then we suggest you check out [Something to Try First](try-first.md).

If you are new to Clojure or ClojureScript altogether, please check out the guide material on the respective official sites:

- [Getting Started with Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
- [ClojureScript Quick Start](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start)

There are also many great books on Clojure. [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) can be read for free online, and is a great resource for beginners.
