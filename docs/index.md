[Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) development in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes inline code evaluation, Paredit, code formatting, a test runner, syntax highlighting, [linting](linting.md), and more. [Calva is open source](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) and free to use.

## Getting Started

First thing you need to do is to get [Calva connected to the REPL of your project](connect.md). Then we suggest you check out [Something to Try First](try-first.md).

!!! Tips
    Calva's code formatter sets the default keybinding of its **Format Current Form** command to `tab`. Meaning that most often when things look a bit untidy, you can press `tab` to make things look pretty. Good to know, right? For performance reasons it only formats the current enclosing form, so sometimes you want to move the cursor up/out a form (`ctrl+up`) first. See [The Paredit Guide](paredit.md) for more on moving the cursor structurally through your code.

I'm glad you asked! Please see the [Calva Development Wiki](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki). (There, in a section labeled **The Tao of Calva**, we also try to make clear *why* you would want to contribute.)
