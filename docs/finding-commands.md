# Finding Calva Commands

Calva relies a lot on that VS Code makes it really easy to find commands by opening the command palette: `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux), `cmd+shift+p` (Mac), and then start typing some words (or part of words) that you think might be in the command.

To leverage this, all Calva commands are prefixed with `Calva`. As an example, say you want to evaluate a form and pretty print it. Then you can do this:

1. Open the command palette
2. Type `calevpr` 

VS Code will match `cal` to ”**Cal**va”, `ev` to ”**Ev**aluate”, and `pr` to ”**pr**etty” in ”**pr**etty print”. It looks like so:

As you can see on the screenshot, VS Code will also reveal the keyboard shortcut for the command. My advice is to make it a habit to try to remember those shortcuts and use them for a more effective workflow.
